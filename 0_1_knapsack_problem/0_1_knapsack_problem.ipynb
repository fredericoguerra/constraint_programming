    "Given a set $I$ of items, each one with a weight $w_{i}$ and estimated profit $p_{i}$, one wants to select a subset with maximum profit such that the summation of the weights of the selected items is less or equal to the knapsack capacity c. Considering a set of decision binary variables $x_{i}$ that receive value 1 if the $i$-th item is selected, or 0 if not, the resulting mathematical programming formulation is:"
